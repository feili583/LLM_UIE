It stores the relationships between entities.\n- **R**: A set of argument role arcs that represent the relationships between argument roles.\n- **A**: A stack used to store action history, tracking the actions that have been performed.\n\n### 2. Transition Operations:\nThese operations are performed during the state transition and affect the stack, queue, and buffer. Each operation is defined as follows:\n- **LEFT-PASS**:    - Adds an arc from the current element **λ(tj)** to the top element of the stack **σ(ei)**, used for generating semantic roles between triggers and entities.\n- **RIGHT-PASS**:    - Adds an arc from the top element of the stack **σ(ti)** to the current element **λ(ej)**, similarly used for generating semantic roles between triggers and entities.\n- **LEFT-RELATE**:    - Adds an arc from the current element **λ(ej)** to the top element of the stack **σ(ei)**, used for generating semantic relations between entities and entities.\n- **RIGHT-RELATE**:    - Adds an arc from the top element of the stack **σ(ei)** to the current element **λ(ej)**, similarly used for generating semantic relations between entities and entities.\n- **NO-PASS**:    - Performs this operation if no semantic role can be assigned between the current element **λ(εj)** and the top element of the stack **σ(εi)**, indicating no valid semantic role relationship.\n- **SHIFT**:    - Moves the current word from the buffer to the stack for processing. Used for handling words in the buffer.\n- **DUAL-SHIFT**:    - When the current element is both a trigger and the first word of an entity, this operation not only moves the current word to the stack but also copies it to the variable **λ** and pushes it to the buffer. This allows simultaneous processing of triggers and entities.\n- **DELETE**:    - Removes the top word from the buffer, indicating that the word no longer needs further processing.\n- **TRIGGER-GEN**:    - Moves the word from the buffer to the variable **λ** and assigns an event label, marking the word as an event trigger.\n- **ENTITY-SHIFT**:    - Moves the word from the buffer to the entity stack **e**, beginning the recognition of an entity.\n- **ENTITY-GEN**:    - Summarizes all elements in the entity stack **e** into a vector representation, assigns an entity label, and moves the representation to **λ**.\n- **ENTITY-BACK**:    - Pops all words off the entity stack **e** and pushes all except the bottom word back into the buffer.\n\n##Instructions:Find the two entities mentioned in the text and determine the nature of their connection.\nLabels include: {\"ent\": [\"opinion\", \"aspect\"], \"rel\": [\"negative\", \"neutral\", \"positive\"], \"event\": {}}.\n\n##Output format: \nBased on the definitions above, return the transition operations in a list.
