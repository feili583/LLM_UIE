Used for handling words in the buffer.\n- **DUAL-SHIFT**:    - When the current element is both a trigger and the first word of an entity, this operation not only moves the current word to the stack but also copies it to the variable **λ** and pushes it to the buffer. This allows simultaneous processing of triggers and entities.\n- **DELETE**:    - Removes the top word from the buffer, indicating that the word no longer needs further processing.\n- **TRIGGER-GEN**:    - Moves the word from the buffer to the variable **λ** and assigns an event label, marking the word as an event trigger.\n- **ENTITY-SHIFT**:    - Moves the word from the buffer to the entity stack **e**, beginning the recognition of an entity.\n- **ENTITY-GEN**:    - Summarizes all elements in the entity stack **e** into a vector representation, assigns an entity label, and moves the representation to **λ**.\n- **ENTITY-BACK**:    - Pops all words off the entity stack **e** and pushes all except the bottom word back into the buffer.\n\n##Instructions:Could you identify the two entities referenced in the text and specify the type of relationship between them?\nLabels include: {\"ent\": [\"opinion\", \"aspect\"], \"rel\": [\"negative\", \"neutral\", \"positive\"], \"event\": {}}.\n\n##Output format: \nBased on the definitions above, return the transition operations in a list.

Used for handling words in the buffer.\n- **DUAL-SHIFT**:    - When the current element is both a trigger and the first word of an entity, this operation not only moves the current word to the stack but also copies it to the variable **λ** and pushes it to the buffer. This allows simultaneous processing of triggers and entities.\n- **DELETE**:    - Removes the top word from the buffer, indicating that the word no longer needs further processing.\n- **TRIGGER-GEN**:    - Moves the word from the buffer to the variable **λ** and assigns an event label, marking the word as an event trigger.\n- **ENTITY-SHIFT**:    - Moves the word from the buffer to the entity stack **e**, beginning the recognition of an entity.\n- **ENTITY-GEN**:    - Summarizes all elements in the entity stack **e** into a vector representation, assigns an entity label, and moves the representation to **λ**.\n- **ENTITY-BACK**:    - Pops all words off the entity stack **e** and pushes all except the bottom word back into the buffer.\n\n##Instructions:Please identify the two entities referenced in the text and determine the nature of their association.\nLabels include: {\"ent\": [\"opinion\", \"aspect\"], \"rel\": [\"negative\", \"neutral\", \"positive\"], \"event\": {}}.\n\n##Output format: \nBased on the definitions above, return the transition operations in a list.
